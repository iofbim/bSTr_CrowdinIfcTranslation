# bSTr_CrowdinIfcTranslation

A small Python utility that interacts with the Crowdin Enterprise API to:

- List untranslated source strings (dry run)
- Optionally translate them using OpenAI and submit as unapproved translations
- Target either a specific source file (`.pot`) or the entire project

This repository is dedicated to the public domain under The Unlicense.

---

## How It Works

- Reads configuration (tokens, project, org) from a local `.env` file
- Uses `crowdin_api` to fetch source strings and post translations
- Uses `openai` to generate Turkish translations (current default target language in code)

Main entry point: `crowdinTranslator.py`

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Crowdin Enterprise account and an existing project
- Crowdin Personal Access Token with API access
- Crowdin organization subdomain (e.g., `yourorg` for `yourorg.crowdin.com`)
- Crowdin project ID (integer)
- OpenAI API key (for AI translation)
- Internet access

Python packages:

- `python-dotenv`
- `crowdin-api-client`
- `openai`
- `requests`

Install them with:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv crowdin-api-client openai requests
```

---

## Environment Configuration (.env)

Create a file named `.env` at the project root with the following keys:

```bash
# CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN=123asd123asd   # add your personal access token here with 
# ORGANIZATION=firstpart                # of the link to project. firstpart.crowdin.com
# CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID=123456             #change this to reflect the project number
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-........            #add your openAI API access token here generated at platform.openai.com
```

Notes:
- `ORGANIZATION` is the first part of your Crowdin domain (no protocol, no `.crowdin.com`).
- The scriptâ€™s default target language is Turkish (`tr`). You can change it in `crowdinTranslator.py` if needed.

---

## Usage

Dry run (no AI, only list untranslated for a specific file):

```bash
python crowdinTranslator.py IfcRailDomain.pot --limit=20 --dry-run
```

Translate & upload using AI for a specific file (creates unapproved suggestions in Crowdin):

```bash
python crowdinTranslator.py IfcControlExtension.pot --limit=20
```

Process the entire project with AI (limit per file):

```bash
python crowdinTranslator.py --limit=50
```

Process the entire project in dry run:

```bash
python crowdinTranslator.py --dry-run
```

CLI flags implemented by `crowdinTranslator.py`:

- `--limit=NUM`: maximum number of strings to process per file
- `--dry-run`: do not call OpenAI or upload; just list untranslated source strings
- Positional `.pot` filename: target only that source file; otherwise the whole project is processed

---

If you use Git, add these entries to your `.gitignore`:

```
.env
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- 401/403 errors from Crowdin: verify `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`, `ORGANIZATION`, and `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` in `.env`.
- 404 file not found when targeting a `.pot` file: ensure the filename matches exactly what Crowdin reports.
- OpenAI errors or costs: you must have a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` and an active billing setup.
- Language: the script currently targets Turkish (`tr`). Adjust `TARGET_LANG` in `crowdinTranslator.py` if needed.
